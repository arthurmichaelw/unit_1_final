# Scooby Doo Snakes and Ladders #
Snakes and Ladders is a board game for two or more players. 
The game originated from ancient India, where it was known as Moksha Patam, was brought to the UK in the 1890s. 
The board is a square grid, a number of "snakes" and "ladders" are pictured on the board, each connecting two tiles. 
The object of the game is to navigate from the bottom left tile, square 1, to the top left tile, square 100. 
A dice roll mechanic is used to move through the game, ladders help you reach the top of the game board quicker, while snakes drop your piece to lower tiles, slowing down your progress. 
The game is supposed to represent the progress of life, or in this case the progress of coding, hidding strides and moving forward, with lightbulb moments helping you progress much further into the process with snakes or hick ups bring you back down to a more struggle bus situation.

## Technologies Used ##
In HTML I used elements like divs, buttons, classes, ids, tables, tr and td. This created the basic structure of my game. 
In CSS I used height, width, background color, transform, border, margin, position, display and xxx.
IN JavaScript I used querySelecter, event listener, inner html, class, constructors, functions, if else loops, style, 

## Approach Taken ##
My approach was to have the basics in html and use css to style and animate the game with JavaScript running program in the background along the game to function. 
I needed a few bits of logic: two players moving through, dice roll, winning or losing event, an event for moving up a ladder, and an event for moving down a snake.

## What i'd like to expand on ##

I'd like to add more players to the game. Up to 6.
I'd like to add some sort of line or object that connects the connect pairs of snakes and ladders.

## Unsolved Problems ##

If they players roll, is above 100 the player piece disappears, until the players location is back on the board and reaches spot 100.

If the player lands on a ! or ? the text gets erased.
